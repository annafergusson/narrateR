# narrater

Depending on where I get to before my talk, there will be either nothing or minimal scripts with my ideas and development for the narrater R package.

The slides for my talk contain more context: [Five ways to make {learnr} even better for teaching](http://bit.ly/learnr5)

Try clicking on the various things [on the demo page](https://annafergusson.github.io/narrater/demo.html) and check out demo.Rmd for how I did this.
